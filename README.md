SWRLAPI
=======

The SWRLAPI is a development environment for working with the [OWL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language)-based [SWRL](http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/) rule language. 
It includes graphical tools for editing and executing SWRL rules and provides and array of Java APIs for working with rules. A SWRL-based OWL query language called [SQWRL](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki/SQWRL) is also provided.


See the [SWRLAPI Wiki](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki) for documentation.

The SWRLAPI is built using the [OWLAPI](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi).

A [Protege-based](http://protege.stanford.edu/]) [SWRLTab Plugin](https://github.com/protegeproject/swrltab-plugin) is also available.
